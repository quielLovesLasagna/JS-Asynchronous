<h1>Rethrowing an error</h1>

Rethrowing an error in JavaScript is a technique used to catch an error in one part of your code and then throw it again to be handled by a higher-level error handler. This can be useful for adding more context or custom handling to the error.

Suppose you have a piece of code that looks like this:

```js
try {
  // Some code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Handle the error, maybe log it
  console.error("An error occurred:", error);

  // Rethrow the error
  throw error;
}
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:
1) We have a try block where we execute some code that might throw an error.
2) If an error occurs, it's caught in the catch block, and we can do some custom handling, like logging the error message using console.error.
3) After handling the error, we use throw error to rethrow the same error. This sends it up the call stack to be potentially caught by a higher-level error handler.

Rethrowing the error allows you to handle the error at different levels of your code, providing more context or custom behavior at each level. For instance, you might catch and log errors at the lower level and then catch and gracefully handle them at a higher level of your application.

Suppose you have two functions: ```innerFunction``` and ```outerFunction```. innerFunction may throw an error, and you want to handle that error in outerFunction. Here's how you can do it:

```js
function innerFunction(value) {
  try {
    if (value < 0) {
      throw new Error("Value cannot be negative.");
    }
    return Math.sqrt(value);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in innerFunction:", error);
    throw error; // Rethrow the same error
  }
}

function outerFunction(value) {
  try {
    const result = innerFunction(value);
    console.log("Result from innerFunction:", result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in outerFunction:", error);
    // You can handle the error at the outer function level
  }
}

outerFunction(-5); // Calling outerFunction with a negative value
```

In this example:
1) innerFunction checks if the value is negative. If it is, it throws an error.
2) Inside the catch block of innerFunction, the error is logged and then rethrown using throw error.
3) outerFunction calls innerFunction with a value of -5.
4) Since innerFunction throws an error, the error is caught in the catch block of outerFunction, and you can handle it there.

This way, you can handle errors at different levels in your code, which can be helpful for providing more context and custom handling as needed. It's a common pattern in error handling when you have functions calling other functions.
